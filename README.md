EDK2 UEFI for Oneplus 5T

Based on Lenovo Miix 630, Samsung Galaxy S8 and Oneplus 5 UEFI firmwares.

Highly experimental and more a proof of concept. Can load 
Windows PE from internal storage cache partition formatted as FAT.

Source is uploaded partially here. (so you cannot build anything successfully)

Building: move all files and folders to "buildfolder/sdm835/OnePlus5tPkg" and run build.sh as root.
Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 and all releases are compiled on 20.04.

Source here will be cleaned in the near future, and bugs on firmware are getting fixed.
